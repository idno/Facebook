Facebook for Known
==================

This plugin provides POSSE support for Known.

**IMPORTANT NOTE : Recent (c. Aug 2018) changes to the Facebook API means that posting from your site to your profile is NO LONGER POSSIBLE. Posting to pages currently is, but it remains to be seen how long that remains true.**

Installation
------------

* Drop the Facebook folder into the IdnoPlugins folder of your idno installation.
* Log into Known and click on Administration.
* Click "install" next to Facebook.

Troubleshooting
---------------

* **My posts appear on Facebook, but only I can see them!** When your Facebook application is in developer mode, posts can only be seen by you or other developers of the app. Take it out of this mode to have those posts available to others.
